\chapter{Promotion and Demotion}

Types and cotypes are dual. Duality is an algebraic notion; it comes
from Category Theory. It does not involve construction or
co-construction. It's a description, not a recipe.

\paragraph{Promotion}
To obtain a cotype from a type:

\begin{itemize}
\item discard the base ctors
\item map (``lift'') the remaining ctors to cofunctions (promotion)
\item add co-constructors
\item lift functions over the type to cofunctions over the cotype
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Demotion}
To obtain a type from a cotype:
\begin{itemize}
\item add base ctors
\item map (``lower'') the remaining co-ctors to functions (demotion)
\item add constructors
\item lower cofunctions over the cotype to functions over the type
\end{itemize}
