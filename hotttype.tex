\maketitle

\begin{ednote}
  Currently this doc contains a (mildly organized) set of notes
  followed by the intro and chapter 1 from the
  \href{http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/}{HoTT Book}.  Eventually
  (maybe) the intro and chapter 1 will contain annotations, comments,
  additional examples, etc., but I have not started that yet, so if
  you are already familiar with the text you need not read them -- I
  haven't (so far as I recall) changed anything.

  The idea is to winnow out some of the strictly mathematical stuff
  leaving the core ``philosophical'' stuff, and annotate the text with
  some comments and quotes from Martin-L\"{o}f, Brandom, etc.  Or
  maybe leave the math stuff in, but annotate it with more detailed
  explanation and examples in programming languages.  In any case the
  purpose is to more fully articulate the link between HoTT's ideas of
  type and judgment (etc.) to the philosophical debates about
  language, assertion, proposition from which they emerged.  Why?
  Because I find those bits of the HoTT a little murky, and
  philosophers like Brandom have a lot to say about the issues.  Also,
  to show more clearly how type theory differs from set theory and
  classic logic.  Another goal is to provide more practical guidance
  to programmers interested in exploring dependent types.

\section{Expressivity}
\label{sect:expressivity}

Instead of ``P is a proposition'' etc. we should say ``P expresses a proposition''.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Determinism}
\label{sect:determinism}

Hypothesis: classical math with LEM and AC is inherently
non-deterministic.  Constructive math(s) and logic(s) that discard LEM
and AC are deterministic.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Modality}
\label{sect:modality}

Classic proofs (that use LEM) are modal.  Consider the way a classic
LEM-dependent proof works.  You start by stating the hypothesis: P is
true.  You assume that P is not true; then you derive a contradiction.
The conclusion is not merely that P is true, however; it is that P
\textit{must} be true.

Constructive proofs, by contrast, are not modal.  They do not say what
must be the case, they say what \textit{is} the case.  Or rather, they
\textit{show} what is the case.  (I leave aside the question of
whether what is, is necessary.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Habeus Corpus Logics}
\label{sect:habeus}

The principle of ``Habeus Corpus'', from the Latin ``(You shall) have
the body'', was once enshrined as a fundamental principle of
Anglo-American law.  It was used to force the State to present a
detainee in person before the court, back in the days when we
occasionally had the temerity to question the wisdom of the State when
it tried to disappear people.

Type theory, and constructive logics generally, operate under a writ
of habeus corpus that is permanently in effect.  Except that this writ
requires the production not of a detainee, but of a witness.  If you
claim to have a proof, you must produce a witness who is competent to
testify to that fact.  So its actually more like a law of evidence,
but I'm too lazy to come up with a clever legalism to express that
idea.

\section{From Truth to Testimony}
\label{sect:truth}

We have propositions as types, and we have non-propositional types
like $\nat$.  There is an obvious conflict of intuitions here.
Propositions, like \(1>0\), have truth conditions; names like \(\nat\)
do not.  How can they be the same kind of thing?

I think the way out of this embarrassment is recognition that the
classic concept of truth is not relevant to type theory; or, in a more
positive vein, that only a deflationary or minimalist notion of truth
should be used in type theory.  In type theory one does not say that a
proposition \textit{is} true or false; instead one says that a
(propositional) type is proven or disproven, or that either it or its
negation has a witness\sidenote{Or, a ``maker'' or ``constructor''.}.  Instead of a concept of truth we have a
concept of testimony.  Of course, ordinarily witnesses testify as to
the truth of some proposition; but the witnesses of type theory do
more than that---or rather they do something else, namely they produce
or ``make'' the proposition.

%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Proof, Witness, Constructor}
\label{subs:pwc}

Type theory seems to have settled on an idiom; one says, for example,
that types have or do not have proofs or witnesses.  But there are
problems with both of these terms.  The former covers too much ground
since it includes non-constructive proofs.  The latter invokes a
misleading metaphor, since a witness testifies to the truth, whereas a
type-theoretic witness to a type constructs (makes, produces, etc.)
something.  In the case of propositional types, constructors ``make''
the proposition (in the sense that they are inferences that terminate
in the proposition); in the case of non-propositional types,
constructors make ``elements'' of the type, which serve as proxies(?) for
the type.

\begin{remark}
  Problem: here again propositional and non-propositional types behave
  differently.  Every proof of a proposition has the proposition as
  its conclusion; they are all ``the same'' because they all have that
  element in the same structural position.  But the proof of
  e.g. \(\nat\) is different.  For example, \(2\) is a witness for
  \(\nat\).  Or rather, anything that constructs \(2\) is such a
  witness.  What all such constructions have in common is \(2\), not
  \(\nat\).  So they are all clearly proofs of \(2\), but we want them
  to be proofs of \(\nat\).  How do we get there?
\end{remark}

\chapter{The Language of \HoTT}
\label{sect:hottlang}

\begin{ednote}
  TODO: disentangle commonly used terminology: parameterized types,
  generic types, algebraic types, generalized algebraic types, types
  indexed/parameterized, polymorphism, parametric polymorphism,
  polytypism etc. etc.
\end{ednote}

\begin{ednote}
  Type formers as entries in a \HoTT{} lexicon, serving not as
  definitions but as (normative) rules of usage.  They don't say what
  the terms mean, they set out how to use them.  That means,
  specifically, the rules governing the notation, not rules governing
  denoted entities.

  NB: rules of use \emph{of vocabulary} \(\neq\) rules of construction
  \emph{of objects}.  But the idea is for one set of rules to work
  both ways.  That's pretty much how model-theoretic semantics
  connects vocab to semantic domain (completeness and consistency).
  The difference is that the TT semantic domain here (i.e. objects and
  their rules of construction) is not a passive, platonistic realm of
  ``real'' objects, but a pragmatic ``field'' of action.  So rules of
  vocab use and rules of construction converge while remaining
  conceptually distinct.  IOW the difference is not metaphysical.

  On this view we treat \HoTT{} as truly a vocabulary rather than a
  theory about something.  Or more precisely as a regimented idiom or
  dialect.  The user is free to treat e.g. \N as ``defining'' a true
  model of the natural numbers, but \HoTT{} makes no such claim.
\end{ednote}

One way to think about mathematics and logic is in terms of objects,
structures, relations, and the like.  etc.

But one can also think of it in terms of vocabularies (or idioms,
etc.).  Then mastering a discipline is not just a matter grasping some
content, but also of acquiring practical mastery over a vocabulary.

The vocabulary of set theory has dominated mathematical discourse for
most of the last 100 years or so.  Starting in the late 1940s, a
competing vocabulary based on category theory began to emerge.  Today
it is not uncommon to see both vocabularies deployed in the same
discourse (lecture, paper).

{\todo Type theory as a vocabulary - mostly confined to logic, then
  computer science.  Etc.  \HoTT{} as the latest distinctive vocab. -
  covering both math and compsci, also regions of logic.
  Significantly different that both set theory and classic logic.}

``it is possible to directly formalize the world of homotopy types
using the class of languages called dependent type systems and in
particular Martin-Lof type systems.'' V. Voevodsky
\url{http://www.math.ias.edu/~vladimir/Site3/Univalent\_Foundations\_files/univalent\_foundations\_project.pdf}

Note: ``class of languages called dependent type systems'' -
languages, not theories

``Type systems are syntactic objects which are specified in several
steps. First one chooses a formal language L which allows the use of
variables and substitution. Then one chooses a collection of relations
on the sets of L-expressions with a given set of free variables which
is stable under the substitutions. These relations are called the
reduction rules and the equivalence relation generated by the
reduction rules is called the conversion relation....  A type system
based on L is defined as a pair of subsets BB and BBg in the sets of
pre-contexts and pre-sequents respectively which satisfy a number of
conditions with respect to reduction and substitution. Elements of BB
are called the (valid) contexts of a type system and elements of BBg
the (valid) sequents of the type system.'' same, p. 3
